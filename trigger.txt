A MySQL trigger is a stored program (with queries) which is executed automatically to 
respond to a specific event such as insertion, updation or deletion occurring in a table.


create trigger t_name
      -> BEFORE/AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE ON tablename
      -> for each row
      -> begin
      -> insert into tablename values (name, city, ......etc);
      -> end;
